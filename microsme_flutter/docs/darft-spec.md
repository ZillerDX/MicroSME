Draft Spec: MicroSME All-in-One Kit (Working Title)

1. Introduction

1.1. Problem Statement

Micro-businesses (e.g., coffee carts, food stalls, market vendors, small mom-and-pop shops) lack access to simple, affordable digital tools. Existing POS, inventory, and accounting software is often too complex, expensive, and fragmented. This forces them to rely on pen-and-paper methods, leading to inaccurate tracking, lost revenue, poor inventory management, and no ability to leverage customer data.

1.2. Solution Vision

A single, mobile-first (iOS/Android for phones and tablets) application that bundles the four most essential business functions into one "stupid simple" interface:

Point of Sale (POS)

Inventory Management

Accounting / Ledger

Customer Loyalty (CRM)

2. Core Principles

Simplicity First: The primary feature is simplicity. If a proposed feature adds significant UI complexity, it will be rejected for V1. The user must be able to use it with minimal to no training.

Offline-First: The application MUST be 100% functional for core operations (making sales, tracking stock) without an internet connection. Data syncs to the cloud for backup when a connection is available.

Affordability: The business model (likely freemium) must be accessible to a shop owner with very low cash flow.

3. Key Feature Modules (High-Level V1 Scope)

3.1. Module 1: Point of Sale (POS)

A simple, grid-based interface showing products or categories.

"Tap-to-sell" functionality to add items to a cart.

Basic cart management (change quantity, remove item).

Ability to record payment type (e.g., "Cash", "Bank Transfer / QR").

Connection to basic Bluetooth thermal printers for receipts.

3.2. Module 2: Inventory Management

Simple item creation (Name, Price, Initial Stock Quantity).

Automatic stock deduction when an item is sold via the POS.

Manual stock adjustment (add/remove stock).

Configurable low-stock alerts (e.g., show a red badge when stock < 5).

Out of Scope for V1: Recipe-based inventory (e.g., 1 "Latte" sold deducts 10g "Coffee" and 150ml "Milk"). V1 will be item-based (1 "Latte" sold deducts 1 "Latte").

3.3. Module 3: Accounting (Ledger)

Automatic logging of all sales from the POS into "Revenue".

A simple form to manually add "Expenses" (e.g., Category: "Supplies", Amount: "500").

A "Daily Summary" report showing: Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Profit (Revenue - Expenses).

3.4. Module 4: Customer Loyalty (Mini-CRM)

Basic customer profile creation (Name, Phone Number).

Ability to attach a customer to a sale via phone number lookup.

Simple point accumulation system (e.g., "1 point for every 50 spent").

Simple point redemption (e.g., "10 points for 1 free drink").

4. Target Audience

Coffee Carts & Small Cafes

Food Stalls & Small Restaurants (1-5 tables)

Market Stalls & Small Retail Shops

Small Service Shops (e.g., barbers, nail salons)

5. Technology Stack (Proposed)

App: React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform)

Local Database: SQLite or a similar on-device DB (to ensure offline-first)

Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore for cloud sync, Functions)

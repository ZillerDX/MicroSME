Example Use Cases

Use Case 1: The Coffee Cart

Actor: "P'Joy," a coffee cart owner.

Scenario: A regular customer orders an "Iced Latte" and wants to use their loyalty points.

Steps:

Joy opens the app on her tablet.

A customer orders one "Iced Latte" (60 THB). Joy taps the "Iced Latte" icon in the POS grid.

The customer asks to use points. Joy taps the "Customer" icon and types in the customer's phone number (081-xxx-xxxx).

The customer's profile appears, showing "Name: Mr. Chai, Points: 12".

Joy's shop rule is "10 points = 1 free drink". Joy taps the "Redeem" button.

The system deducts 10 points (leaving 2) and applies a 60 THB discount to the cart. The total becomes 0 THB.

Joy taps "Complete Sale" (Payment Method: "Redemption").

Behind the Scenes (App):

Inventory: Stock for "Iced Latte" item is reduced by 1.

Accounting: A "Revenue" of 0 THB is logged (or 60 THB revenue with a 60 THB discount, depending on accounting choice).

CRM: Mr. Chai's profile is updated to 2 points.

Use Case 2: The Small Retail Shop

Actor: "Hia Meng," owner of a small shop selling t-shirts.

Scenario: At the end of the day, Hia Meng wants to check his earnings and see what stock is low.

Steps:

Hia Meng opens the app on his phone.

He navigates to the "Accounting" tab and taps "Daily Summary" for today.

The app shows: Total Revenue: 6,800 THB.

He remembers he paid for a new delivery. He taps "Add Expense" -> Name: "New Stock", Amount: "2,500 THB".

He returns to the "Daily Summary". It now shows: Total Revenue: 6,800, Total Expenses: 2,500, Net Profit: 4,300.

He then navigates to the "Inventory" tab.

He sees "Black T-Shirt, Size L" is highlighted in red, with stock showing "3". This is his low-stock threshold.

He knows he needs to re-order this item tomorrow.
